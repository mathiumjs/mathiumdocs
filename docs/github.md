Want to clone the repo into your local machine to make a contribution to the framework? What about customizing the framework to your needs, implementing it in your code, and perhaps even sharing it with others by creating a pull request?

In that case, we invite you to check out the Mathium [GitHub](https://github.com/mathiumjs/mathiumjs) repository!

We look forward to seeing you on there. It's the best way to contribute to the community, learn more about the framework, experiment with hands-on experience in open source, and even customize it to your heart's desire!

Best, <br />
The Mathium Team
